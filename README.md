# Canto Namespaces Protocol

Canto Namespaces Protocol is a subprotocol for the Canto Identity Protocol that enables users to mint names with tiles that are contained in trays. Trays can be minted for a fee or traded on the secondary market.

## Tray
A tray is represented as an ERC721 token (NFT). Each tray contains 7 tiles (see below). A user calls `buy` and passes in an `amount` to buy the specified amount of trays. Each tray has a fixed price. The 7 tiles per tray are then generated according to a deterministic algorithm. A user can therefore precompute which trays he will get.

An image for every tray is dynamically generated. Two example trays are shown here:
![Example Tray 1](./docs/sample_tray1.svg)

![Example Tray 2](./docs/sample_tray2.svg)

There is a prelaunch phase where trays can be minted for distribution to the community. However, these trays can only be used (transferred or fused) during the prelaunch phase and become useless afterwards. 

## Tile
A tile is one character in a specific font. Different fonts have different probabilities to appear in a tile. The fonts are:
| **Font Class** | **Name**        | **Shares** | **Characters** |

*For emojis that support skin tone modifiers, these can be specified when fusing. For instance, 👍 becomes 👍🏿 when the skin tone modifier 5 is passed. The following skin tone modifiers are supported:
| **Value** | **Modifier**        |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 0         | Yellow, no modifier |
| 1         | 🏻                   |
| 2         | 🏼                   |
| 3         | 🏽                   |
| 4         | 🏾                   |
| 5         | 🏿                   |


**Note that the Zalgo distortions are individually generated for every tile. The number of characters is therefore much higher, as every character can appear with different distortions.

## Namespace
Different tiles can be fused to a namespace NFT. For instance, you can fuse the name 𝒸𝓪𝔫𝖙🅾 if you own trays with these characters (in these fonts). Afterwards, the name 𝒸𝓪𝔫𝖙🅾 will resolve to the fused namespace NFT. For namespaces, an image is also generated dynamically on-chain, e.g.:
![Example Name](./docs/sample_name.svg)

### Fusing
To fuse a namespace NFT, the user specifies the trays and the tiles (offsets) within the trays to use. Note that the whole tray is always burned, even if you only use some tiles of a tray.
For some emojis, the user can specify a skin tone modifier which will be applied.

A fusing fee that is proportial to the length of the name is charged.
